<a href="/papers/visas.pdf">How Restricting Migrants' Job Options Affects Both Migrants and Existing Residents</a>
</b>
(with Corey Allan).</p>
<p class="abstract">
Governments often restrict international migrants' job options. This paper shows that these restrictions can hurt not only migrants but also the existing residents whom they aim to protect. We study New Zealand’s ‘Essential Skills’ work visa, which was New Zealand's main work visa between 2008 and 2022. Essential Skills migrants could only work for firms which could not find New Zealanders. Loosening restrictions for a single individual has no impact on their wages: migrants who win an unrestricted resident visa through a lottery switch jobs more frequently, but receive no gain in wages. However, when the Essential Skills job restrictions were loosened for <em>all</em> migrants in an occupation, both job-switching and wages typically grew. These results are consistent with a wage-posting model in which each firm pays migrants and residents equally; in such a model, the wage received by each worker will not depend directly on her own outside option but rather on the distribution of outside options among her colleagues. We estimate a wage-posting model, and compare equilibrium wages under the Essential Skills job restrictions to a counterfactual simulation in which migrants’ job options are unrestricted. The restrictions decreased migrants' average wage by 8%. Although most residents were unaffected by the restrictions, 2.1% had their wage decreased by more than 2%. The restrictions increased profits, especially in firms which employed many migrants. The restrictions decreased annual welfare by $292m NZD — 30% of migrants' earnings — largely because migrants could not move to firms which they preferred for non-pecuniary reasons.</p>

(with <a href="https://jesse-silbert.github.io/">Jesse Silbert</a>).</p>
<p class="abstract"> We construct a job matching model to study a labor market in which firms do not price discriminate among their workers. While an efficient stable outcome always exists, inefficient outcomes can be stable as well. Workers’ preferred stable outcome is efficient. Firms prefer inefficient stable outcomes in which they pay lower salaries.</p>

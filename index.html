<p class=paper_title><b><a href="/papers/market%20design%20monopsony.pdf">Job Matching without Price Discrimination</a></b>
(with <a href="https://jesse-silbert.github.io/">Jesse Silbert</a>), 2024.</p>
<p class="abstract"> We construct a job matching model to study a labor market in which firms do not price discriminate among their workers. While an efficient stable outcome always exists, inefficient outcomes can be stable as well. Workers’ preferred stable outcome is efficient. Firms prefer inefficient stable outcomes in which they pay lower salaries.</p>

<p class=paper_title><b>How Restricting Migrants' Job Options Affects Both Migrants and Existing Residents</b>
(with Corey Allan).</p>
<p class="abstract">Governments often restrict migrants' job options. This paper shows that these restrictions can hurt not only migrants but also the existing residents whom they aim to protect. We study New Zealand’s `Essential Skills' work visa, which was New Zealand's main work visa between 2008 and 2022. Essential Skills migrants could only work for firms which could not find New Zealanders. Loosening restrictions for a single individual has no impact on their wages: migrants who win an unrestricted resident visa through a lottery switch jobs more frequently, but experience no gain in wages. However, when the restrictions were loosened for <em>all</em> migrants in an occupation, the wages of both migrants and residents typically grew. These results are consistent with a wage-posting model in which each firm pays migrants and residents equally; in such a model, the wage received by each worker will not depend directly on her own outside option but rather on the distribution of outside options among her colleagues.  We estimate such a model, and compare equilibrium wages to a counterfactual simulation in which migrants' job options are unrestricted. The Essential Skills job restrictions decreased migrants' average wage by 8%. While most residents were unaffected by the restrictions, 2.1% had their wage decreased by more than 2%. The restrictions also increased profits, especially among those firms which employed many migrants. The restrictions decreased annual welfare by $292.m NZD — largely because they prevented migrants from moving to firms which they preferred for non-wage reasons.</p>

<p class=paper_title><b>Why Some Workers Earn More Than Others</b>
(with <a href="https://jesse-silbert.github.io/">Jesse Silbert</a>).</p>
<p class="abstract">We document substantial earnings inequality between workers in the same firm and (narrowly-defined) occupation. We then ask whether this wage inequality reflects variation in firms' willingness to pay by tracking how a firm's profits are affected by a worker's separation. Though firms have greater willingness to pay for better-paid workers, we find no relationship between residual wages and value-add.</p>

<p class=paper_title><b>Can Market Power Explain the Gender Wage Gap?</b>
(with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/savannahnoray">Savannah Noray</a>).</p>
<p class="abstract">Women tend to earn less than men in the same occupation. Women also tend to work in lower-paying occupations. We present a unified model of both the within-occupation and the between-occupation gender wage gaps. In a calibration exercise, employers' market power explains 90% of the within-occupation wage gap and all of the between-occupation wage gap.</p>
